# scalaProgramming

This is a repository of solutions to my assigments at class "Scala" at my university. I try to write all function without alredy implemented functions in standard library. I also try to write all my code as functional as possible since this is the main goal of this class.



## Testing
U can get this repository to your local computer with: git clone https://github.com/Meemaw/scalaProgramming

To test implementation write sbt in week$i and write test.
